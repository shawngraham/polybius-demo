The verdict was the culmination of a decade-long investigation that revealed a sophisticated transnational network connecting Italian tomb robbers to the world's most prestigious museums and private collections. This data story traces the geographic, financial, and interpersonal contours of that network — from Medici's first dealings in 1960s Rome, through the Swiss freeport warehouses, London auction rooms, and American museum boardrooms, to the courtroom where the system was finally exposed.",

Medici purchased it from tombaroli, transported it to Switzerland, and sold it to Robert Hecht, who then sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for one million dollars — at the time, the most expensive antiquity ever purchased.

Then the chart spikes dramatically in 1999 (the estimated €19 million Freeport inventory) and 2005 (the €10 million court fine).

The network graph shows a system — a supply chain with specialized roles at every stage: extraction (tombaroli), consolidation (Medici), laundering (Geneva Freeport and Sotheby's auction provenances), distribution (dealers like Symes, Hecht, Tchacos, and the Aboutaams), and acquisition (museums and private collectors). The financial data shows that this system moved millions of dollars in cultural property over decades. The timeline shows that it took institutional will — coordinated action by the Carabinieri and Swiss police — to disrupt what market incentives alone could not. The geographic map shows that the system exploited jurisdictional boundaries: objects crossed from Italy to Switzerland to England to the United States precisely because each border crossing made legal accountability harder. These are not four separate stories. They are four views of the same structure, told through the same data.\n\nHere's an example of embedding youtube.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0UNNAQvF58&t=103s",
